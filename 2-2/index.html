                <p>As I'm thinking that I start to come to and notice my surroundings.
                   <br> The lights in the car are dimmed; the exit signs glowing a bright green.
                   <br> The screen displays are off and the car lacks the usual company of mid-morning commuters.
                   <br> <span class="thoughts">The powers off in this car again? Why does this always happen to me, weird that everyone left already though, I bet the cars next to this one are crazy crowded now. </span>
                   <br> I realize it then. From inside this car I can't see the lights from the neighboring ones, not even through the windowed doors that lead to them.
                   <br> “What..?”
