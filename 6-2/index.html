                <p>I look over at one of the doors.
                   <br> <span class="thoughts">Maybe… Maybe I can get out, the train is moving, but maybe I can still jump off of it.</span>
                   <br> I stumble over to the doors.
                   <br> I slowly wedge my fingers between them and pull like my life depends on it. They open and I push them back as far as they go.
                   <br> Then I’m hit with something. Or maybe I’m hit with the lack of something.
